# Basecamp42

My completely undocumented and fairly naive take on 42's Basecamp (https://42.fr/en/homepage/), a ~20 days event where you learn to use shell and code in C with virtually no teachers, just the 42 Basecamp community, a couple short videos in french and some fairly information-lacking & poorly-translated project descriptions. Still, one of the best learning experiences of my life and the gateway to 42cursus, where the real deal begins.
